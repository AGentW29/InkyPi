# Troubleshooting

## InkyPi Service not running

Check the status of the service:
```bash
sudo systemctl status inkypi.service
```

If the service is running, this should output `Active: active (running)`:
```bash
● inkypi.service - InkyPi App
     Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/inkypi.service; enabled; preset: enabled)
     Active: active (running) since Sun 2024-12-22 20:48:53 GMT; 28s ago
   Main PID: 48333 (bash)
      Tasks: 6 (limit: 166)
        CPU: 6.333s
     CGroup: /system.slice/inkypi.service
             ├─48333 bash /usr/local/bin/inkypi -d
             └─48336 python -u /home/pi/inky/src/inkypi.py -d
```

If the service is not running, check the logs for any errors or issues.

## Debugging

View the latest logs for the InkyPi service:
```bash
journalctl -u inkypi -n 100
```

Tail the logs:
```bash
journalctl -u inkypi -f
```

## Restart the InkyPi Service

```bash
sudo systemctl restart inkypi.service
```


## Run InkyPi Manually

If the InkyPi service is not running, try manually running the startup script to diagnose. This should output the logs to the terminal and make it easier to troubleshoot any errors:

```bash
sudo /usr/local/bin/inkypi -d
```

## API Key not configured

Some plugins require API Keys to be configured in order to run. These need to be configured in a .env file at the root of the project.

Navigate to the root directory of the InkyPi project on the raspberry pi terminal, and save the api key in the .env file:
```bash
cd InkyPi
vi .env
```
